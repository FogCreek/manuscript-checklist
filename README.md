Checklists are Awesome
======================

Everybody loves checklists, and now you can have them in Manuscript.

 - Start a new checklist on the sidebar of the case view
 - Add, change, reorganize, delete, and complete items easily
 - Delete a checklist by removing all items
 - Save a checklist as a template for future use (in progress)

**TODO:**
 - clean up. Names, organization, you know the drill
 - title. They have an id... but need a title (use for templating too)
 - CSRF?
 - POST in the body


Embeddable in Manuscript using public/customization.js. Just fill in the matching .env values on lines 5 and 6 and paste into a [customization](http://help.fogcreek.com/11209/applying-client-side-style-and-script-customizations?manuscript=1)
