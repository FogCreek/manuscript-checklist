Checklists are Awesome!
-----------------------

Everybody loves checklists, and now you can have them in Manuscript.

 - Start a new checklist on the sidebar of the case view
 - Add, change, reorganize, delete, and complete items easily

![Create a Checklist from scratch](https://cdn.glitch.com/3ac0c3f6-40e7-4fd1-be5e-348efc28126f%2Fchecklist%20from%20empty.gif?1512877547974) ![Create a Checklist from a Template](https://cdn.glitch.com/3ac0c3f6-40e7-4fd1-be5e-348efc28126f%2Fchecklist%20from%20template.gif?1512877548183)

Embeddable in Manuscript using public/customization.js. Just fill in the matching .env values on lines 5 and 6 and paste into the js section of a [customization](http://help.fogcreek.com/11209/applying-client-side-style-and-script-customizations?manuscript=1). No need for any css in the customization

Helpful hints:

 - Changed your mind? To delete a checklist, remove all the items
 - Have a common checklist for many cases? Create named templates by visiting /checklist/<your template name>, add your items, and then click the "Save as Template" button
 - Remix this app for complete control over, well, everything! :)
